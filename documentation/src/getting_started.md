# Getting started

Getting started with MomentoBooth is easy! You only need a computer/laptop with webcam. Specifically, follow these steps:

1. Download the latest MomentoBooth release for your OS from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/h3x4d3c1m4l/momento-booth/releases).
1. Extract the zip file and run the MomentoBooth executable.
    * It may be convenient to place a shortcut on your desktop.
1. You will be greeted by the homescreen saying "Touch to start" and a green background. Press `Ctrl+S` to open the settings panel. â†’ [See all shortcuts](settings_general.md#hotkeys).
1. Go to the **hardware** tab
1. Ensure [live view method](settings_hardware.md#live-view-method) is set to "Webcam" and select your webcam from the list in the [webcam setting](settings_hardware.md#webcam). The [capture method](settings_hardware.md#capture-method) is set to "Live view source" by default.
    * If you do not have a webcam available you can also select "Static noise" as a live view source for testing.
1. Next, go to the **output** tab.
1. Set an [output directory](settings_output.md#local-photo-storage-location) to save your photos.
1. Next, go to the **templating** tab.
1. Set a [template directory](settings_templating.md#template-location) to look for template files.
1. Go to that directory in your file explorer and place a background (portrait) image called `background.jpg` or `background.png`.
1. You are now ready to shoot your first pictures! Press `Ctrl+S` again to exit the settings screen and click on or touch the screen to get started.

Once you have the basics up and running you can try [connecting a camera](camera_setup.md#camera), [adding a printer](printer_setup.md), or designing a beautiful [template](template_setup.md) for your next event.
