# Settings import

This settings panel contains a UI to import a settings fragment and apply the settings in the fragment over your existing settings. This can be handy to, for example, copy someone else's printer layout settings. Before the settings are applied, a pop-up will appear to show you the settings that will be changed if the ‘overlay’ is applied. Changes are highlighted in bold.

A settings fragment can be supplied through dragging and dropping a `.toml` file, plain text, or browsing for a `.toml` file.

The same UI is also presented in the onboarding wizard.
