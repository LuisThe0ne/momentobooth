# The concept

This page will briefly explain the concept and user experience of MomentoBooth. The interface is meant to be used with a touchscreen, though other ways of controlling the software are being considered. As any photobooth software, the main mechanic is to capture photos at the end of a countdown, present users with some themed version of that picture. Optionally this picture can be printed or downloaded.

MomentoBooth has two main capture modes: single capture and multi-capture.

## Single capture

In single capture mode, the software only takes a single photo and presents the user with the result. Whether this is just the picture or a collage with 1 picture depends on the user's project settings. The user can choose to retake a picture if the result is deemed unflattering. The output file is then overwritten by the new picture.

## Multi-capture
In multi-capture mode, a the picture taking process is repeated 4 times in a row. Then, the users are presented with a collage creation screen where they can choose which pictures they want to include in their collage, and in which order. They can thus opt for a result that contains 1, 2, 3, or all 4 photos that were taking, resulting in different layouts.

The layout with 3 pictures is the one classically used by other photobooth softwares, and will be printed as two strips in one print. These can be cut automatically by supported printers.

After finishing the selection process the users can optionally print or download their collage on the share screen, but also have the option to go back and change their collage. This will overwrite the file.

## Advanced: manual collage mode
This mode is not accessible from the normal usage flow, but can be entered from the menu or by pressing `Ctrl+M`. In the manual collage mode, the user (probably the moderator) is presented with a list of _all_ captured input images, and can create new collages from this material at will. This allows, for example, the creation of multiple collages of the same 4 captures, or the creation of collages of manually shot pictures of the event.
