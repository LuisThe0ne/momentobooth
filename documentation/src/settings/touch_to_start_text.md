### Alternative ‘Touch to Start’ Text

<!-- FIXME why do we call it theme color here and primary color above? -->
Text inserted in this setting field will override the text that will be shown on the Start screen instead of ‘Touch to start’. Leave empty to show the default text from the translations data.
