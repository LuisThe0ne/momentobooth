### Treat Single Photo as Collage

This setting determines how a single photo is processed within the photo booth application.

If enabled, a single picture will be treated as if it were a collage with 1 photo selected. This means that the photo will undergo collage processing, even though it contains only one photo.

If disabled, the single photo will be used unaltered.
