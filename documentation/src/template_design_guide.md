# Guide for designing templates

First, get the application to run [as described in the getting started guide](getting_started.html#running-the-application).

> You don't need a webcam or webcam for developing templates, but it is fun to test your creations. If you don't have one, you can select one of the debug options for the live view method.

Once you have the application running, do the following.

1. Open the settings with `Ctrl+S` and go to the templating tab.
1. Set the right [aspect ratio](/settings_templating.html#collage-aspect-ratio) and [padding](/settings_templating.html#collage-padding) according to the printer that you will use (see e.g. [recommended settings for printers](printer_setup.html)). When not using a printer, you can leave these as-is. Set the [output resolution multiplier](/settings_output.html#output-resolution-multiplier) to a sufficient value, e.g. `4`.
1. Go to the output tab and set the output format to `png`.
1. Get template guide image files
   1. Go back to the templating tab, scroll down to the template preview, and turn off the back- and foreground. You can choose if you want to include the middle ground with placeholder images.
   1. Hit `export`.
   1. You will find your guide images in the collage export folder you set-up in the getting started guide.
1. Optionally, go to the output tab again and set the output format back to `jpg`.
1. Using the guide images, you can design your templates.
   1. Place your files in the templates folder you configured. See the [templates page](/template_setup.html) on how to name your files.
   1. You can check the result using the template preview in the templates tab, by shooting a collage, or using the manual collage screen (`Ctrl+M`). If you made changes to your templates, go to a different settings tab and back to the templates tab to reload the images.
