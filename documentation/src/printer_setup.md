# Printer

Printing your photos and having a physical reminder of an awesome event is one of the most fun parts of having a photo booth. Therefore MomentoBooth has well-configurable printer support! For an overview of the available settings to tune printing, see the [printer hardware settings](settings_hardware.md#printing) and [template settings](settings_templating.md).

Getting the print settings right requires quite a bit of trial and error. Ideally a print shows the full collage without parts being cut-off or white borders. For this purpose you probably want to use borderless printing.

## Recommended settings for Canon Selphy CP1300/CP1500

The Canon Selphy series of printers is quite convenient for photo booth purposes. Here are settings that are known to be approximately right for using this type of printer.

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| [Collage aspect ratio](settings_templating.md#collage-aspect-ratio) | 1.48 |
| [Collage padding](settings_templating.md#collage-padding) | 10 |
| [Page height](settings_hardware.md#page-height) | 148 |
| [Page width](settings_hardware.md#page-width) | 100 |
| [Printer margin top](settings_hardware.md#page-margins-used-for-printing) | 0.0 |
| [Printer margin right](settings_hardware.md#page-margins-used-for-printing) | 1.6 |
| [Printer margin bottom](settings_hardware.md#page-margins-used-for-printing) | 0.5 |
| [Printer margin left](settings_hardware.md#page-margins-used-for-printing) | 1.6 |
| [Use printer settings](settings_hardware.md#use-printer-settings-for-printing) | On |

Make sure to set the default settings of the printer to **portrait mode**, **borderless**, and the right paper-size.
