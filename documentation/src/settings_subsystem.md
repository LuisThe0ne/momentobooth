# Subsystem status

This settings tab contains an overview to quickly check for and solve any issues that may arise in the functionality of the app. For this purpose, the status of each subsystem is shown, which can either be `busy`, `ok`, `disabled`, `warning`, `error`, or `deferred`. When a problem arises, the subsystem may present actions/fixes in through buttons to resolve the situation.
