### Capture Location

This setting specifies the location where the photo booth application will look for images captured by an external tool, such as `Sony Imaging Edge Desktop`.

**Description:**  
The "Capture Location" is the folder path where the photo booth application will search for images captured using external tools. This allows the photo booth to access and display images taken separately, for instance, with `Sony Imaging Edge Desktop`.
