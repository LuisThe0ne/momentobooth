# MQTT integration settings
This settings panel allows setting up the MQTT integration feature.

If the integration is enabled, the application will publish MQTT messages to the specified broker and will subscribe for commands.

## Connection
This section contains all settings related to the connection with and authentication for your MQTT broker. Set these up according to your broker settings.

## Client
These settings specify the publication topic and client ID.

## Home Assitant integration
Integration with Home Assistant is available, so automations can be created that respond to the state of the app in real time. Settings are available for the discovery topic (usually `homeassistant`), and the device ID.
