### Printer
Like explained in the MomentoBooth capabilities, the application has multi-printer support. The `Printer i` setting with `i` `1, 2, ...` allows selecting which printer(s) to use. Every selected printer will create another printer setting in the UI.

The options for a printer selection (in the form of a combo-box) are the printers currently configured on the OS. Icons show if the selected printer is currently connected and whether it is the system's default printer or not.

It is possible to select the same printer multiple times. Prints are assigned round-robin.
