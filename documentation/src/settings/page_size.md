### Page Size (normal, split, small, tiny)

This setting specifies the _page size_ used for creating a print for the selected _print size_.

When a page size is configured for a given print size, a user can choose between _normal_ print size, _small_ print size, and _tiny_ print size.
The _split_ page size is used when a normal print size is selected and the collage to be printed is a split-layout, i.e. 3-photo layout.

**Options**:

The options for this setting are populated by the available page sizes for the first selected printer in the CUPS section. The size name is given, followed by the corresponding dimensions in mm.
